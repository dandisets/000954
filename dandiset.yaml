description: 'The dataset contains neural activity from a period of open loop calibration
  from a participant enrolled in --- .

  Data was recorded from two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays in the hand
  "knob" area . The 7DoF are: 3D endpoint translation (x,y,z) 1D orientation (roll),
  and 3D grasp (flex/ext of thumb, index, ring, flex/ext of ring/pinky, thumb abduction).

  On each trial, audiovisual cues indicated to the participant to attempt a particular
  reach or grasp involving a combination of the listed degrees of freedom.

  Agreement:

  - I will receive access to de-identified data and will not attempt to establish
  the identity of or attempt to contact any of the subjects.

  - I will not attempt to make direct contact with PIs, affiliated data partner PIs,
  or staff at sites concerning the specific results of individual subjects. Data partner
  PIs may be contacted about potential collaboration opportunities.

  - I will not further disclose these data beyond the uses outlined in this agreement
  and my data use application and understand that redistribution of data in any manner
  is prohibited.

  - I will require anyone on my team who utilizes these data or anyone with whom I
