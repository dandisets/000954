description: 'The dataset contains neural activity from a period of open loop calibration
  from a participant enrolled in --- .

  Data was recorded from two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays in the hand
  "knob" area . The 7DoF are: 3D endpoint translation (x,y,z) 1D orientation (roll),
  and 3D grasp (flex/ext of thumb, index, ring, flex/ext of ring/pinky, thumb abduction).

  On each trial, audiovisual cues indicated to the participant to attempt a particular
  reach or grasp involving a combination of the listed DoF.'
